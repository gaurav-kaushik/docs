This repository contains a tutorial, as an ipython notebook, that shows how to filter The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using queries into the metadata. The queries are sent using the query language SPARQL. The files satisfying the query are then downloaded using Seven Bridges API for the Cancer Genomics Cloud.
